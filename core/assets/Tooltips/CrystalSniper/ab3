CrystalSniper prepares for future encounters, empowering his next Crystal to have a bonus effect. CrystalSniper can charge up to three times. Each charge causes his next Crystal to deal 10% more damage, as well as adding a bonus effect based on the amount of charges CrystalSniper has.

One Charge: The Crystal ignores 15% of its targets' magic defence.
Two Charges: The Crystal damages any enemies within two meters rather than one.
Three Charges: The Crystal stuns all enemies hit.
