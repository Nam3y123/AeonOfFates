Portal
3 Turn Cooldown
No Cost
Neither

CrystalSniper creates two portals; one at a location within two meters of himself and one two tiles away from the other along a line. These portals face away from each other and last for one turn. If CrystalSniper launches a normal attack or Crystal Blast through one portal, the projectile will be teleported to the other portal, destroying both portals in the process.
