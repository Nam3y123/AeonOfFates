Discharge

CrystalSniper's normal attacks have above-average range and pass through enemies hit, but only deal 5 (+50% atk) (+50% mag) magic damage and only apply on-hit and on-attack effects to the first target they hit.

Upon reaching maximum range, these normal attacks converge into a Crystal. Crystals will explode after a one-turn delay, dealing 23 (+2 per level) (+100% mag) magic damage to all enemies within one meter of it. Crystals interact with CrystalSniper's abilities in a variety of ways.
